# The CityWalks #


### Introduction ###

Semantic segmentation nowadays becomes an interesting topic to many researchers and practitioners in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. There are numerous challenges that are publicly available; one of them is the Cityscapes which is very popular in the semantic segmentation task intended for autonomous driving applications. However, the Cityscapes provides the annotations to only learn the name of objects. Meanwhile, for traffic scene understanding purposes, additional information describing a particular object such as its attributes is important to enrich the semantic information and may help improve the segmentation performance.

We construct the CityWalks, which is an extension of the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/), by re-annotating the original ground truth with additional labels corresponding to four pedestrian’s body orientations. It is constructed to challenge the attribute-aware semantic segmentation task aimed at understanding the pedestrians’ walks. Information regarding pedestrian’s moving orientation is meaningful and important for driving assistant and possible risk avoidance.

The re-annotation process is applied to the original Cityscapes’ ground truth provided in training and validation sets, containing 2,975 and 500 images, respectively. The ground truth re-annotation was conducted manually and very carefully by appointed annotators with considering details in pixel-level using a conventional image editor. By extending the class person into four classes representing pedestrian’s orientation classes (back, right, front, and left) and preserving the original class of person, the CityWalks provides trainable 23 classes encoded in ‘trainId’.

### Download the dataset ###

The CityWalks will be publicly available as a third party contributor to the basis Cityscapes dataset through [this page](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/). The downloaded package will include:
1. Annotated ground truth
   * gtFine_color: train, val
   * gtFine_labelid: train, val
   * gtFine_trainid: train, val
2. Supplementary scripts and files that support the CityWalks


### How to Use the Data? ###

1. Download the CityWalks package, place the dataset (folder: 'CityWalks', including all folders and files in it) in your designated directory.
2. It's preferable to use a .txt file to list all input and ground truth pairs for training your model.
3. Ensure your model has been set with 23 classes for the number of final layer's output.
4. Train your model using the CityWalks, as how you train a semantic segmentation model.
